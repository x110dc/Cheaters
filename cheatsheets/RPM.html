                The following command will list all of files in 
                an installed RPM package. It works only when the package is already installed on 
                your Linux system.
              </p>

                Use the following command to determine which installed package
                a particular file belongs to.
              </p>

              <pre>rpm -qf /usr/bin/mysql</pre>

              For example:

              <pre># rpm -qf /usr/bin/mysql
mysql-3.23.52-3</pre>

                Use RPM to query a (possibly) un-installed RPM file with
                the use of the the "-p" option. You can use the "-p" option 
                to operate on an RPM file without actually installing anything. This command lists all 
                files in an RPM file you have in the current directory. Also note that RPM can query
                remote files through the FTP and HTTP protocols.

                Use RPM to list all files that do NOT pass 
                the verify tests (done on size, MD5 signature, etc).
              </p>

              <pre>rpm --verify mysql</pre>

              <p>
                Where a file does NOT pass, the output 
                is listed using the following codes that signify what failed:
              </p>

              <pre>S File size
M Mode (includes permissions and file type)
5 MD5 sum
L Symlink 
D Device 
U User 
G Group 
T Mtime</pre>

              <p>
                Take for example the following:
              </p>

              <pre># rpm --verify mysql
S.5....T c /etc/my.cnf</pre>

              <p>
                This example indicates that file <tt>/etc/my.cnf</tt> failed on:
              </p>

              <pre>File size
MD5 Sum
Modified Time</pre>

              <p>
                However, the "c" tells us this is a configuration file so 
                that explains the changes. It should still be looked at to
                determine what the changes were.

                RPM can be used to check the PGP signature 
                of specified packages to ensure its integrity and origin. Always use this command 
                first before installing a new RPM package on your system. Also, GnuPG or Pgp 
                software must be already installed on your system before you can use this command.
